    <h1>Pseudo-classes</h1>
    <p style="background-color: red;">
Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document
tree.

One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible
element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover.

A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that
may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[7] Note the distinction between the
double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for pseudo-classes.
